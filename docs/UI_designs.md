1. MountainMerge — “Summit Collaboration”
(Clean, collegiate, Lehigh-aligned; elevated but modern)
1. Core Philosophy
A system centered on “reaching the summit together.” Clean structure, warm academia-inspired tones, and layered elevation effects reflect teamwork, clarity, and intellectual ascent.
2. Color Palette
    •    Lehigh Brown – #4E3629 (stability, trust, academic heritage)
    •    Summit Gold – #D6A84E (achievement, clarity, optimism)
    •    Glacial White – #FAF9F7 (cleanliness, focus)
    •    Ridgeline Gray – #8C8C88 (neutral balance)
    •    Pine Accent – #2E4F3D (grounding contrast)
3. Typography
    •    Primary: Inter (sans) — for clarity and digital-first legibility
    •    Secondary: Libre Baskerville (serif) — for titles to retain collegiate character
    •    Hierarchy Rules:
    ◦    H1: Libre Baskerville 34–40pt / 1.15 line-height
    ◦    H2: Inter Semibold 24pt
    ◦    Body: Inter Regular 15–16pt
    ◦    Caption: Inter Medium 12–13pt (uppercase allowed for navigational labels)
4. Spacing & Grid
    •    8-pt base system
    •    Columns: 12-column grid on desktop, 4-column on mobile
    •    Card padding: 20–24px internal
    •    Vertical rhythm: increments of 8 to reinforce structure and calm consistency
5. Signature Visual Element
Layered mountain ridgeline dividers — gentle overlapping contour lines that subtly separate sections, referencing the campus’s mountainous geography.
6. Motion Principles
    •    “Upward glide” transitions: components slide upward 12–16px when revealing new content.
    •    Soft easing: cubic-bezier(0.33, 0.07, 0.18, 1)
    •    Micro-interactions: peaks light up with a shimmer on success states (uploads, shares).
    •    Hover states: elevation shadow grows subtly (2dp → 6dp) to reinforce the “summit rise.”
Inspirations
Notion (structure), Slack (collaboration UI rhythm), Headspace (gentle motion tone), Apple Notes (minimal clarity).



3. Leafline — “Organic Knowledge Flow”
(Soft, nature-inspired, calming; wellness-based productivity)
1. Core Philosophy
Ideas grow when nurtured; design mimics natural flow and organic connection. Rounded shapes, soft gradients, and plant-inspired textures communicate ease and harmony.
2. Color Palette
    •    Sprout Green – #8BC34A (growth, approachability)
    •    Dew Mint – #CFF5E7 (calm, clarity)
    •    Soil Brown – #7A5E42 (earth, grounding)
    •    Sky Soft Blue – #A4D7F5 (freshness)
    •    Leaf Dark – #355E3B (contrast, depth)
3. Typography
    •    Primary: Quicksand (rounded, friendly)
    •    Secondary: Source Serif Pro for long-form note reading
    •    Hierarchy Rules:
    ◦    H1: Quicksand Bold 36pt
    ◦    H2: Quicksand Semibold 24pt
    ◦    Body: Source Serif Pro 16pt (excellent for reading)
    ◦    Metadata: Quicksand Medium 12pt green-tinted
4. Spacing & Grid
    •    10-pt base system (less rigid than 8-pt, adds organic variation)
    •    Grid: fluid 6-column with flexible gutters
    •    Whitespace priority: large padding (>28px) around reading surfaces
    •    Curved separators soften boundaries
5. Signature Visual Element
Organic branching lines representing note connections — soft curves that animate when linking documents or users.
6. Motion Principles
    •    Flow motion: elements gently “bloom” (scale 0.96 → 1.0)
    •    Gradient sweeps: soft diffused transitions
    •    Slow, mindful durations: 240–300ms for main transitions
    •    No sharp edges or sudden easing changes
Inspirations
Asana “flow” mode, Calm app, Pinterest’s soft transitions, Duolingo’s rounded friendliness.



ChalkChapter — “Modern Chalkboard Academia”
(Nostalgic classroom chalk meets modern UI minimalism)
1. Core Philosophy
Learning begins with the chalkboard. This system modernizes that tactile experience with chalk dust textures, matte surfaces, and handwritten personality.
2. Color Palette
    •    Chalkboard Green – #1E3F2F (traditional academia)
    •    Chalk White – #FFFFFF (clarity, nostalgia)
    •    Dust Gray – #AFAFA7 (chalk residue)
    •    Soft Yellow Stickynote – #F8E27A (analogue warmth)
    •    Berry Accent – #C25283 (playful highlight)
3. Typography
    •    Primary: Nunito (friendly geometric sans)
    •    Accent: Kalam (chalk-like handwritten text for small areas)
    •    Hierarchy Rules:
    ◦    H1: Nunito ExtraBold 40pt
    ◦    H2: Nunito Bold 28pt
    ◦    Body: Nunito Regular 16pt
    ◦    Annotations: Kalam 15pt in Chalk White or Soft Yellow overlays
4. Spacing & Grid
    •    6-pt base to emulate slightly imperfect analog spacing
    •    Grid: 12-column with chalk-like textured dividers
    •    Card edges: 6px rounded corners, matte finish
    •    Sticky-note elements break out of the strict grid intentionally
5. Signature Visual Element
Digital chalk strokes — hand-drawn underline, highlight marks, and borders that animate in as if written by chalk.
6. Motion Principles
    •    Wipe-in chalk drawing animations (mask reveal with slight particulate noise)
    •    Smudge fade-outs when deleting items
    •    Bounce-lift on drag mimics a sticky note peeling up
    •    Slight hand-drawn jitter on hover (2–3px micro-noise)
